# R-Sloan-Digital-Survey
The Objective is to understand different factors responsible for distinguishing a celestial object, 
whether it be a star, galaxy or quasars by building a model. The model uses various independent variables 
to predict if the celestial body. The goal is to achieve highest accuracy as possible by using the data to
train the model on different algorithms so as to choose the best one.
