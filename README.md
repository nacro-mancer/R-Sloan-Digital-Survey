# R-Sloan-Digital-Survey
The Objective is to understand different factors responsible for distinguishing a celestial object, 
whether it be a star, galaxy or quasars by building a model. The model uses various independent variables 
to predict if the celestial body. The goal is to achieve highest accuracy as possible by using the data to
train the model on different algorithms so as to choose the best one.


## Observations
By observing on different models, we can conclude that the data is more suitable for logistic regression model.
The Highest accuracy achieved is 99% with the logistic regression model, while other models like SVM linear performing well enough.
KNN classifier has the poorest accuracy, it doesnâ€™t perform well for quasar class specifically.
